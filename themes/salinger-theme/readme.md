# Salinger ✨🌈📻

___Salinger___ is a __new-born clean-mimalistic mobile-first blazing-fast fancy__ and __lightweight__ but __powerful theme__ for [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io).
Born as the theme for [my personal website (where you can see a demo)](http://jacksalici.com), I'd like to develop a lot of other stuffs, starting with the following feature. 
Why this name? During the development of the minimalism of this theme I was inspired by [_The Catcher in The Rye_ Einaudi Italian edition cover](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=il+giovane+holden+by+j.d.+salinger+einaudi+1961&t=h_&ia=images&iax=images&iaf=color%3AWhite), by J.D. Salinger,
